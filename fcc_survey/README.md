# Survey Form

This is a super basic survey form from the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design curriculum!

## User Stories
(A user story is an Agile tool that captures the description of a software feature from an end-user persepctive. A good user story describes the type of user, what they want and why. It's like a simplified description of a software requirement.)

User Story #1: I can see a title in H1-sized text.

User Story #2: I can see a short explanation in P-sized text.

User Story #3: I can see a form.

User Story #4: Inside the form element, I am required to enter my name in a field.

User Story #5: Inside the form element, I'm required to enter an email.

User Story #6: If I enter an incorrectly-formatted email, I'll see an HTML5 validation error.

User Story #7: Inside the form, I can enter a number in a field.

User Story #8: If I enter non-numbers in the number input, I'll see an HTML validation error.

User Story #9: If I enter numbers outside the range of the number input, defined by the min and max attributes, I'll see an HTML validation error.

User Story #10: For the name, email, and number input fields inside the form I can see corresponding labels that describe the purpose of each field.

User Story #11: For the name, email, and number input fields, I can see placeholder text that gives me a description or instructions for each field.

User Story #12: Inside the form element, I can select an option from a dropdown.

User Story #13: Inside the form element, I can select a field from one or more groups of radio buttons. Each group should be grouped using the name attribute.

User Story #14: Inside the form element, I can select several fields from a series of checkboxes, each of which must have a value attribute.

User Story #15: Inside the form element, I am presented with a textarea at the end for additional comments.

User Story #16: Inside the form element, I am presented with a button to submit all my inputs.
